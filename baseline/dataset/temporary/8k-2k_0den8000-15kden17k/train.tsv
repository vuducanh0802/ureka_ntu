1004	282	Yup, and in a fair system, they'd be banned for it too.  Twitter isn't a fair system.  That's the whole point.    And as for Weev, yes, he was in the wrong.  You can't openly call for terrorist bombings to teach the Jews a lesson or whatever wink wink nudge nudge crap he was trying to pull.	0
1007	283	Because it's better than the alternative, which is to let the #TechLeft continue to control the entire industry.	1
1010	284	Yes yes, I've heard it before.  And I agree, they are free speech.    But guess what, the site is a few days away from going dark forever, again, possibly because of racist shitposts that were 1 tiny step away from a call to violence against Jews.    Not everywhere is fucking /pol.	0
1013	285	Yesterday, when I saw his tweets, I reported him to Twitter as potentially suicidal.    Today, I noticed during one of my refreshes, as Twitter's censorship algorithm failed briefly, that one of his replies to another person flat out stated he was going to kill himself.	0
1016	286	I want to point out something horrific about Twitter's #censorship today.    A vlogger I'm a fan of posted a few disturbing tweets last night.  I was concerned as they seemed a little dark, incoherent, and very out of character.	0

1075	345	I actually live in Fresno County where Janz is a deputy DA.  A kid who was my catcher in Little League works with him and his Dad is a judge.   I guess I have to talk to family friends about Janz and his lack of response.   Sad. No I am not troll Chuck Johnson. lmao.  He's a rude douche. My question was seen by the facebook team on 8/3.  lol.   @a @Amy @Microchip  #maga #gabfam	0
1079	346	Twitter algorithm that's said to be unavoidable (part can't be turned off!) is now affecting politicians running for office. @janzforcongress has less outreach than he has followers.  Since outreach is your audience plus followers that interact audience.  That's weird and he must be caught up in it.

1870	979	Prayer and fasting and staying in a state of grace can relieve demonic influence. Possessions are much more difficult. An exorcist has the power to deliver victims, but sadly, faith is so low in Church echelons today that there are far fewer exorcists, and a proliferation of demonic activity, and priests are reporting the exorcisms are taking longer. It's a perfect storm. Fr. Amorth (RIP)...	0

2945	2327	One thing that Conservatives never talk about is how disgusting infanticide laws are. Forget abortion for a minute, reduced sentences for killing the already born is disgusting. Not sure if the USA has a similar law, but in Canada killing of babies under 1 year of age is covered under special infanticide laws to quote 'provide a partial defense'.	0
2948	2328	The reason I think that many leftists want to shut down free speech beyond the commonly discussed pursuit of their collective 'all or nothing' narrative is that most of them are at best non-eloquent, and at worst, too unintelligent, to try to argue their point with any nuance, details, or rationality.	1
2951	2329	I guess the big news to share with fellow Gabbers is how our far-left Prime Minister in Canada has instituted a new law: all faith based organizations have to tick a box for financial assistance applications that says they support abortion or they will not receive funding. Of course, these churches and organizations do not tick it...Big deal up here.	0

3071	2380	This is why it's hard to take qanon believers seriously ('if you don't believe my pet theory, I'll insult you until you do'). Also note: This is the same person who thinks the leftist who wrote the first wiki (WikiWikiWeb) is the founder of Wikipedia. He's not. If you want to convince us, you really need to understand far more than dubious connections.	0
3075	2381	I suspect the person behind at least one of the current incantations of 'Q' is actually somewhat smart. They started this ploy that Trump will declassify everything on the left--but only if the media asks him 'is Q real?' So, you might imagine this has all the 'qultists' in a tizzy. Cruel but effective. Unfortunately, it makes us look insane.	0

3687	2857	Thanks to the ever-expanding cancer of the 2003 Communications Act, we now have German-style anti-Holocaust denial laws in the UK, introduced by the judiciary with no public debate. http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/even-...	0
3690	2858	The Far Left's march through the institutions continues. If you want to ask a programming question on StackOverflow, they would like you to first check your privilege and take a scientifically-unsound 'implicit bias test'. https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overfl...	0
3693	2859	Not content with arresting YouTubers over dog videos, the useless out-of-control British Thought Police are now arresting teenagers for posting the lyrics of commercially-available rap records on social media. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-43...	0
3696	2860	I don't understand why these small-fry US politicians bother to introduce blatantly un-constitutional bills against free speech. Do they not realise that the law will be immediately shut down by the courts due to its violation of the First Amendment? Or do they just not care, as long as they can go back to their backers and say 'Hey, I tried!'?	0
3699	2861	New article by yours truly on the Dankula Nazi pug case. Once, British citizens laid down their lives to fight against fascism. Now we are behaving like the Nazis once did by jailing people over sieg-heiling dogs. http://quillette.com/2018/03/26/online-hate-speech...	1
3702	2862	I'm no great fan of Corbyn, but at this point he seems to be the only adult left in the room. Perhaps we SHOULD wait for some actual evidence before jumping to conclusions and trying to start World War 3. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43424867	0
3705	2863	Even the BBC have now condemned the state and the media (including themselves) for covering up or playing down child abuse scandals. Took a while, but we got there in the end. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43400336	0
3708	2864	Brendan O'Neill hits the jackpot as always. Harassing people in the street or in their homes is, and should be, a crime. But treating that crime differently because of the victims' religion is even worse. http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/is-it...	0
3711	2865	'The orders would allow courts to electronically monitor suspects' whereabouts before they have been found guilty of - or even committed - a crime.' 1984 is here, folks (or perhaps Minority Report). http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43319733	0

3724	2878	One reason the deep state has gotten as bad as it has is that sensible (ie not liberal) people aren’t even applying for government jobs. I’ve spent the last week and a half reviewing resumes and we’re scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Pay is pretty good, benefits are great, and the bar is set low so it’s easy to impress your boss.	1
3727	2879	God bless my grandmother. Hospitalized with a broken back an barely aware of what’s gong on around her thanks to a lot of pain medicine, today in a lucid moment says “I don’t care what anyone says, I like Trump.” #MAGA	0

3770	2901	The fact that President Trump won didn't change a thing. In fact I have to wonder if that's what Obama told Trump during the transition.  It's too coincidental Trump comes out and says guns should be taken without due process. Then we get supposed Republican governors supporting the same thing.	0
3773	2902	This present gun control situation sucks. But the reality is had Hillary won, we'd be where we are right now. All this hate for white men, men in general, republicans, conservatives, guns, that has been fueled and fired for the last 15 months; it was in the plans all along for deep state.	0
3777	2907	The left make trump out to be way more powerful than a president really is. Don't they know that the president's job (and what Trump has been doing) is to enforce the laws as passed by congress? Immigration law is clear about what the president's job is at the border so unless they can change the laws they need to shut up and deal with it.	0

7217	6474	(Repost) Good news, everyone! I was able to get Bodyslide & Outfit Studio to work on Linux via Wine for Fallout 4. NO TWEAKS NEEDED! Just download and place it where you normally would on Windows. That being said, you need to make sure the path to the game's executable is 100% visible. Lutris used a hidden folder when it was initially installed. Happy Modding :)	0

7382	6626	Despite what #FakeNews media like to spread, violent crimes in USA are almost always lower than in Europe. Socialism destroys humanity and dignity, it is artificial and deeply damaging to the human psyche. Free people embody the highest moral values. We are at our best when we are free and individualist. You can only help others if you are strong yourself.	1
7385	6627	People need to be proud of themselves and their country and identity. Strength is only possible if you are not made to lower your head. UK and USA are not alone in this destruction of self worth, these leftists do it to all, least of all India. #BritFam #Brexit	1
7388	6628	They tried to con voters then accuse leavers of doing the things they did. It is textbook war of attrition in the political sense. The establishment was once servant to the people now it is a tyrant imposing their will on the free and sovereign people. EU has slowly destroyed the pride and power of peoples and will not stop until a full and hard #Brexit is achieved	1
7391	6629	They may have come to work but Democrats trap them in the welfare plantation and use them as a vote bank. They are the new type of slaves used to destroy USA	1
7394	6630	I don’t matter what you invent history is on my side when you get an ignorant shit to restate imaginary history even if he is a British numbnut good for you	0
7397	6631	I’m so tired of anti Semitic crap, white guys became pussies and is their fault no one else. jews couldn’t organize a piss up in a brewer. White guys are weak because they forget how to be dominant and it is their women who made them like that not any one else.	1

7406	6634	India makes active pedophilia a death penalty crime I don’t know what muslims are going to do but India may end up exterminating any true muslims who follow pedo Muhammad’s example with Aisha. Half the British & American establishment may also end up executed if they act on their perversions. All in all, a good outcome, time for the West to follow this example.	1

7412	6648	It's funny to me how I'll be saying exactly what I say on Twitter  - it's not as though I'm holding back there. Twitter just doesn't see that my common sense beliefs could be anything but evil.	0

7424	6652	I will be. I unfollowed everyone because many of the accounts I followed over a year ago so are no longer active. Same as Twitter, I tend to follow accounts with content I like and those who I speak with regularly. I tend to keep the 'ratio' pretty high because it's hard to see everything :/	0
7427	6653	Of course. They're 'brown people', and can't be held to the same standards as 'us'.     My response is that I speak often about the slaughter of the Copts in countries like Syria. Also brown. Also speaking Arabic. But with an entirely different ideology.	1

8328	7599	What can we learn from the story of South Africa? First World nations can only exist and be maintained under a First World people. Now you know the story of South Africa. It's founding, creation and subsequent fall from grace. Demographics are destiny. THE END.	0
8332	7600	In my first thread, I referred to South Africa by calling it the most successful and prosperous country in Africa. Under White rule, it was. However, when Whites de-colonised and handed power to Blacks, South Africa fell into ruin and despair, with the White minority persecuted.	1
8336	7601	Finally, in 2018, the South African government chose to seize White farmers' lands without compensation. In 2016, Julius Malema joked that they 'are not calling for the killing of Whites just yet...'	0
8340	7602	Despite his portrayal in the western media, Nelson Mandela and his former wife Winnie Mandela, were really nothing more than Communist terrorists. People still worked on behalf of Mandela while he was imprisoned. Mandela was never a man worth idolatry.	0

8348	7604	Enough Whites are currently being killed by Blacks in South Africa, that it can easily be classified as a form of genocide against the White population. For a first hand look into the violence and its victims, watch Lauren Southern's 2018 documentary 'Farmlands.'	0
8352	7605	Life for the White population currently living in South Africa is plagued with hardship and danger. Over 10% of Whites are currently living in poverty, with no prospects of improving themselves in their present conditions.	0
8356	7606	In the next 20 years, Mandela's rule turns South Africa, the once crowning jewel of the African continent, into a Third World country. As of 2018, Cape Town is now experiencing a water shortage, making it the first capital city in the world to run out of water.	0
8360	7607	1990: Nelson Mandela is released from prison after the South African government caves in from outside pressure. He returns to a heroes welcome, both in public and in the press. Finally, in 1994, the Whites lose their power as the Nelson Mandela is elected leader of South Africa by a majority Black vote.	0
8364	7608	1976: The Soweto uprising occurred, as huge numbers of Black students began violently protesting the Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 which forced the Afrikaans language upon its Black students.

9353	8792	For us, we didn't decide to leave our megachurch because of huge issues. But there were TONS of little ones. In cases like that, where do you draw the line? We can blow off small issues to a certain point. But when it's every week, you start digging deeper. For me, the tipping point was the 'employee satisfaction survey' they gave the worship team.	0
9356	8793	One of the things that really threw me for a loop was the way they throw around the 'Spirit of Excellence' argument to justify dropping HUGE money on production and 'experience' which has nothing to do with the gospel. If God isn't working in someone, slick production won't change that. If God is, then none is needed.	0
9359	8794	What we've discovered in our journey from super-conservative churches into charismatic circles is that most modern churches have very little to no theology background. It's rather depressing to see what passes for 'sound teaching' now. Itching ears, and all that.	0
9362	8795	Some of you know, I've had some issues with our church in the last few months. We left a small country church for a (smallish) mega-church remote campus about 9 months ago. Huge production budget, high music standards. Tons of pressure and stress. Good things happening, but we just can't keep up.	0
9365	8796	I played some of U2's 'Joshua Tree' for my wife and kids yesterday. I said 'which group do you think it sounds like? Hillsongs? Elevation Worship? Bethel?' And they laughed when I told them it was U2 from 20 years ago. Uncanny resemblance.	0
9368	8797	As far as the software guitar setup I've been tweaking, it still works well. But my hardware setup is just easier to set up and use. I'll probably use software when I get to recording again. Much easier to use software when it's already going into the computer.	0
9371	8798	One of the things I've been wanting to work on is trying out Bitwig Studio on my Linux rig for live music production (instead of Ableton Live). The full version isn't free, but if it works as well as Live, it's worth the money. We'll see how it goes.	0
9374	8799	Things have been good since I've taken a month off of playing music at church. I was putting in 15+ hours a week just doing that. Now I am resting, and have time to do things I've been neglecting. Lots of projects coming up.	0

9380	8801	What I've come to realize over the years (and I'm not young) is that there are very few people with new ideas, and even fewer who can articulate those ideas effectively. 99% of what we see and hear is regurgitated pablum. Doesn't interest me at all.	0

10883	11461	I may have said this before, but the issue keeps cropping up. If Trump is asked to come in for an 'interview', it should be under the same conditions Hillary set when she appeared for questioning on her multiple Federal felonies...

10891	11463	Well, at least #HillaryClinton managed to rename a highway and a post office (see https://tinyurl.com/yd74p6jy for details), so if Kammie can't even match that, she should definitely run! https://tinyurl.com/y8mvuhn8	0
10895	11464	Trump ought to publicly announce he will meet with Mueller with exactly the same conditions Hillary had in place when she was interviewed in July, 2016 regarding her multiple Federal felonies -- not under oath, no notes or recordings allowed, lawyer (who was a material witness to at least one of the felonies) present to screen all questions. Nothing less.	0

11807	12453	YOU WERE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD COME FOR YOU NEXT.  The Alt-Right warned you. We told you exactly what would happen.  YOU DIDN’T LISTEN. You didn’t want to be called “racist.” Now it will be even harder for you to fight back, because you’ve already made it clear that your issue is not *all* censorship of lawful speech, but merely the *degree* of censorship.	0
11811	12454	I have no doubt their censorship of the right-wing — through suspensions, bannings, shadowbannings, & hashtag/trend manipulation — has already cost Republicans multiple elections. In very close races, social media sentiment could easily have made the difference. Roy Moore’s supporters were heavily censored in the days before that election.	0

11897	12498	What the FISO Memo is proving us is that the government isn't run for the people, but it's a machine to enslave the populous for the self-decided elite class. This will lead to the populous taking matters into their own hands, hanging the traitors, and providing the justice system that was stripped from us by the people we trusted.	0
11900	12499	What the progressives aren't acknowledging when it comes to the FISO Memo, and even illegal immigration is that citizens don't take matters into their own hands as an agreement that the government will do its job of law, order, & justice. However, the people will self-govern and judge if the government proves it can't/won't do the job.	0

13768	14625	I know 'Lebensraum' just means living space. Absent context, there's nothing sinister about it. But using it as a proper term, you call to mind Hitler and his justifications for war. He used it to talk about *Germany's* 'living space'. His use was in a zero sum game. My use of 'more space' should not be considered 'Lebensraum'	0
13771	14626	@pitenana‍  A point: Yesterday (two days ago?) you recharacterized my declaration that 'we need room!' as 'Lebensraum'. I didn't react, but in retrospect, I should have clarified: 1) I'm talking about *humanity* needing more room. 2) I'm talking about expanding the pie, not taking more 'living space' by taking from others.	0

15188	17290	5/ And finally the pitch – sign up for their mailing list which they totally won’t sell to anyone else…because they are already professional spammers who will flood your inbox with a toxic combo of paranoid rants and terrifying examples of why you should buy all your stuff from them.	0
15192	17291	4/ The 200 ads on each page screaming for you to buy (buy! BUY!) the latest in expensive survival gear (including some variation of a 70lb+ bug out bag for those times you are both bugging out and invading South America) and weapons.	0

15199	17293	2/ I'm convinced that the majority of prepper sites are scams. They all have the same basic pitch. Like they have a checklist or something. It starts with some guy claiming to be an ex-Delta Ranger Scuba Sniper (so you can totally trust what he’s going to sell you).	0

15589	17917	You don't understand the difference between an operating cost and an unfunded liability. USG can stop or reduce welfare any time. Social Security is a decades-long commitment.

15592	17918	Welfare is a conditional month-to-month affair. Social security is a 20-30 year commitment with virtually no strings attached.

Look at the passage, it clearly says that Jesus is telling a parable, hence why it's known as The Parable of the Ten Minas in Christian theology. U've chosen a single verse & isolated it from not only the passage, but from Jesus’ message and the rest of the Bible, in attempt to justify ur irrational hatred	1
16747	19153	This is part of a parable in which Jesus was telling a story intended to teach a lesson, not a command by him to kill anybody. The direct words there are what Jesus was quoting a King to have said within the story.

19448	22240	Why aren't Democrats holding rallies to compete with Trump's massive cheering crowds? Two reasons, in my opinion:   1.They keep telling themselves, and everyone else, that rallies don't matter. To do so would be admitting that they do matter, and playing by his rules.   2.They have no one on their side that can draw a crowd like he can. They don't want be embarrassed, and exposed by tryin...	1
19452	22241	Truth isn't truth when a factual truth is used to support a lie. Example: Texas Senate candidate Beetle O'Rourke uses a factual truth; supporters donate directly into his campaign through a PAC website, to support the lie that he doesn't take money from PACs, with the unspoken inference that he doesn't take their support either. The PACs facilitated the donation, if not for them he would not have...	0

19459	22243	In 2004, Sandy Berger, former National Security adviser to President Clinton, stole documents from the National Archives, and cut them up with scissors in order to hide one of Clinton's many messes. His punishment?

19467	22245	Why doesn't President Trump declassify the pertinent documents in this case, you ask? That would cause everything to be settled, you say.  Well, it is because he realizes that this story is too big, and too important to be dumped on the public, in one big steaming pile when no one is watching.
